description: awesome application which should be run on a huge touch screen at a bus stop of the future!

The project is made during participation in Junction 2016 hackathon (Helsinki, November 25 — 27, 2016).

Main functions:
– show timetable of the transport for the current bus stop;
— show city map with other bus stops and information about these bus stops;
— show current time and weather;
— show advertisement and important news for tourist and locals;
— provide "stop button", which future passenger has to press to indicate that he needs the closest bus to stop.

Application is build on Windows Universal Platform. As part of the project we used sample Azure App example, reittiopas.fi service (with map and transoprt information). Weather data is fetched from http://openweathermap.org/.
